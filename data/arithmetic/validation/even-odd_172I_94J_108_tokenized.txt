\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:172> \cdot <var:I> + <nat:94> \cdot <var:J> + <nat:108> $ is even using every unknowns $ <var:J> $ , and $ <var:I> $ . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} It can be shown that our proposition must be true . This claim holds by reason that $ <var:J> \times <nat:94> + <nat:172> \times <var:I> $ is known as even , because the totaling between even natural numbers concurrently with an even natural is guaranteed to be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . We know the whole number $ <nat:94> $ is trivially an even positive integer . In consequence , the product $ <nat:94> \cdot <var:J> $ is even also . In addition to this , the whole number $ <nat:172> $ is known as an even natural . For this reason , the pair $ <var:I> \cdot <nat:172> $ is even in addition . as well as since multiplying between even whole numbers with some element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ the summation $ <nat:172> <var:I> + <nat:94> <var:J> $ is guaranteed to be by definition even . Recall the totaling between even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ concurrently and an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
