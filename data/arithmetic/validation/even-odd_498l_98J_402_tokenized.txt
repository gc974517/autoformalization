Notice that $ <var:l> * <nat:498> $ is obviously even . This claim is true as a consequence that the multiplication between an even natural number with an arbitrary natural must be even . Building on , observe that the term $ <var:J> * <nat:98> $ is obviously an even natural as a consequence that the multiplication of an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ and an arbitrary whole number must be even . Since the multiplication between even positive integers with an arbitrary element of $ \mathbb{N} $ will be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ the sum $ <var:l> * <nat:498> + <nat:98> * <var:J> $ is guaranteed to be even . We know that $ <nat:402> $ is known as an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . The summation between even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ together and an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is clearly an even natural . \end{proof} \end{document}
