The term $ <nat:170> \times <var:C> $ is known as even . This fact holds from the knowledge multiplying between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with an arbitrary number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be even . Recall that $ <var:e> \times <nat:328> $ is clearly even as a consequence that multiplying between an even integer and a number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be instrinsically an even natural . This lemma is true from the knowledge the summing of an even natural number with even integers is guaranteed to be even additionally as a consequence that taking the product of even whole numbers and any element of $ \mathbb{N} $ is instrinsically an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
