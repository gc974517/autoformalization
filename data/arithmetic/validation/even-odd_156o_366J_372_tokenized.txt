\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} For any natural terms $ <var:J> $ , and $ <var:o> $ $ <nat:156> \cdot <var:o> + <nat:372> + <var:J> \cdot <nat:366> $ will be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} It can be verified that the result is true . Remember that $ <nat:372> $ is an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . The formula $ <nat:156> * <var:o> + <var:J> * <nat:366> $ is obviously even . We know that the addition of even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ collectively is an even number . Remember that $ <nat:366> \times <var:J> $ is known to be even . The product $ <nat:156> \times <var:o> $ is clearly even . This holds from the knowledge multiplying between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ and a element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ will be instrinsically an even number . as well as since the multiplication between an even integer and a number in $ \mathbb{N} $ is guaranteed to be by definition an even natural . \end{proof} \end{document}
