See that $ <nat:316> $ is known to be an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . The term $ <var:X> * <nat:340> $ is known to be even . This holds by reason that taking the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and some integer is guaranteed to be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . We know $ <var:C> * <nat:324> $ is obviously even . This is true as a consequence that the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and an arbitrary integer will be by its very nature an even whole number . \end{proof} \end{document}
