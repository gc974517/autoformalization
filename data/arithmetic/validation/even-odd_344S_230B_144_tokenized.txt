We demonstrate that $ <nat:344> <var:S> + <nat:230> <var:B> $ is even . See that the adding of even numbers in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ concurrently with an even integer is even . $ <nat:230> \times <var:B> $ is known as an even natural number . This fact holds as a consequence that taking the product between an even integer and any natural number must be even . The term $ <nat:344> \times <var:S> $ is an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . This fact holds by reason that taking the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with some element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ will be even . and likewise from the knowledge taking the product between even integers and a natural number will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
