We know that the natural number $ <nat:142> $ is obviously even . For this reason , $ <nat:142> <var:v> $ must be even also . The product $ <var:u> <nat:372> $ is known as an even natural by reason that the integer $ <nat:372> $ is clearly even . Observe the pair $ <nat:302> <var:d> $ is clearly an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . This fact is true since multiplying of an even whole number with an arbitrary element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ will be even . This fact holds since the whole number $ <nat:302> $ is an even positive integer . See that the pair $ <var:K> <nat:46> $ is known to be an even whole number . This holds as a consequence that the leading term $ <nat:46> $ is known to be fundamentally an even whole number . See that the leading term $ <nat:70> $ is clearly even . Therefore , the term $ <var:s> <nat:70> $ must be even additionally . On top of this , see the pair $ <nat:332> <var:C> $ is known as even because the multiplication between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with an arbitrary integer is guaranteed to be obviously an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . This claim must be true from the knowledge the natural number $ <nat:332> $ is trivially even . The summation of even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ concurrently is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
