Notice that the product $ <nat:162> <var:Q> $ is known to be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . This claim is true because the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and some number in $ \mathbb{N} $ must be an even natural . Further , take note that the product $ <nat:384> <var:K> $ is trivially an even whole number . This claim is true since the multiplication of an even natural number with an arbitrary positive integer is even . The summation $ <var:Q> * <nat:162> + <nat:384> * <var:K> $ is even from the knowledge the totaling between an even whole number and even positive integers is guaranteed to be even and likewise since multiplying of an even whole number with an arbitrary natural is even . \end{proof} \end{document}
