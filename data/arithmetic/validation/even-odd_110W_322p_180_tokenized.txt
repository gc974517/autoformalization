We work with the assumption the understanding that the expression $ <nat:180> + <var:p> <nat:322> + <nat:110> <var:W> $ is clearly even by reason that $ <var:W> \times <nat:110> + <nat:322> \times <var:p> $ is guaranteed to be even , from the fact the addition of even elements of $ \mathbb{N} $ together and an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ is an even natural number . Notice that the positive integer $ <nat:110> $ is clearly even Recall the natural number $ <nat:322> $ is known as an even integer as well as from the knowledge taking the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with a number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be fundamentally an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ $ <var:W> <nat:110> + <var:p> <nat:322> $ is even . Observe that the summing of even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ collectively with an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ will be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
