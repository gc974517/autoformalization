See that the term $ <var:M> \times <nat:142> $ is trivially even . This claim is proven from the fact taking the product of an even number and an arbitrary natural number must be trivially an even whole number . Likewise , $ <var:g> \times <nat:448> $ is clearly even . This claim is proven by reason that the multiplication of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and a number in $ \mathbb{N} $ must be instrinsically an even positive integer . What's more , the pair $ <var:K> \times <nat:68> $ is guaranteed to be an even positive integer as a consequence that multiplying between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ and a positive integer must be even . This main result is true as a consequence that the addition of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even and likewise by reason that the multiplication between even numbers with an arbitrary element of $ \mathbb{N} $ will be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
