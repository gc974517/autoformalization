\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} For every whole numbers $ <var:c> $ $ <var:c> \cdot <nat:112> + <nat:188> $ will be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Notice that the adding of even integers successively and an even integer is even . The pairs $ <var:c> \times <nat:112> $ are known as even natural numbers . This claim is true from the fact the multiplication between an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with any integer must be by its very nature an even integer . This is proven because the leading terms $ <nat:112> $ are trivially even positive integers . We prove the expression $ <var:c> <nat:112> + <nat:188> $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
