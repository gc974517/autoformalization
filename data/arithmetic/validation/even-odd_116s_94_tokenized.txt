\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:94> + <var:s> \cdot <nat:116> $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Take note that $ <nat:94> $ is clearly even . Because the summing between even integers together with an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ must be an even whole number , as a consequence this result is proven . Remember that the pair $ <nat:116> * <var:s> $ is known to be even from the fact taking the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and some positive integer is guaranteed to be fundamentally an even integer . \end{proof} \end{document}
