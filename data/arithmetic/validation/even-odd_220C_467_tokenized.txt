\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <var:C> \times <nat:220> + <nat:467> $ will be odd assuming all $ <var:C> $ . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} We check the main result is true . See that the pair $ <var:C> \cdot <nat:220> $ is guaranteed to be even . This fact is proven by reason that the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and an arbitrary natural must be an even natural number as well as the leading term $ <nat:220> $ is obviously even . The summation of an even whole number with an odd whole number is guaranteed to be by definition an odd number . \end{proof} \end{document}
