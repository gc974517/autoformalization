\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} With every $ <var:c> $ , and $ <var:K> $ $ <var:c> * <nat:324> + <nat:412> + <nat:370> * <var:K> $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Recall the product $ <var:K> <nat:370> $ is known as even . This claim is true by reason that the multiplication between an even natural and some number must be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . See the term $ <nat:324> <var:c> $ is obviously an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ from the fact multiplying of an even natural number with a element of $ \mathbb{N} $ must be by definition an even whole number . \end{proof} \end{document}
