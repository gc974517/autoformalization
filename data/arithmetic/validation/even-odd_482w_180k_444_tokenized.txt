\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} For positive integers $ <var:w> $ , and $ <var:k> $ the formula $ <nat:482> \cdot <var:w> + <nat:180> \cdot <var:k> + <nat:444> $ will be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Notice that $ <nat:444> $ is known to be an even integer . It can be demonstrated that this theorem is true . See that the formula $ <nat:180> \times <var:k> + <nat:482> \times <var:w> $ is known as even . Remember the integer $ <nat:482> $ is known to be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ Recall that the number $ <nat:180> $ is known as even As a consequence that the addition between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and even whole numbers is by itself an even whole number , the summation $ <var:w> \times <nat:482> + <nat:180> \times <var:k> $ is trivially even . \end{proof} \end{document}
