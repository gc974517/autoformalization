\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:180> + <var:N> \times <nat:294> $ is guaranteed to be even taking some whole numbers $ <var:N> $ . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} The summing between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ and an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ is an even integer . For this reason , this theorem holds . Remember that $ <nat:180> $ is known to be even . Notice $ <nat:294> * <var:N> $ is known as even . This claim is true because the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and any number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even , which is proven since the integer $ <nat:294> $ is known as even . \end{proof} \end{document}
