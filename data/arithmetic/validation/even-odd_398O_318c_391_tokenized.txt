\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:391> + <var:c> * <nat:318> + <var:O> * <nat:398> $ will be odd . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} See $ <nat:391> $ is obviously odd . Notice the adding between an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an odd natural number will be odd . Our theorem is proven by reason that $ <nat:398> * <var:O> + <nat:318> * <var:c> $ is known as even . The term $ <var:O> \times <nat:398> $ is an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . What's more , remember the pair $ <nat:318> \times <var:c> $ is guaranteed to be an even number . This fact is true from the knowledge taking the product between an even natural number with an arbitrary element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is even . From the fact the totaling between even integers with an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even , and also by reason that the product of an even whole number with a element of $ \mathbb{N} $ must be by definition an even natural . \end{proof} \end{document}
