Recall that the summing of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even . Building on , the pair $ <nat:316> \cdot <var:u> $ is known to be even . This claim holds as a consequence that taking the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with a whole number is an even number and likewise the whole number $ <nat:316> $ is clearly even . See that the number $ <nat:404> $ is trivially an even natural . Therefore , $ <var:C> \cdot <nat:404> $ is even also . Notice that the pair $ <var:W> \cdot <nat:294> $ is known as an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ from the knowledge the multiplication of an even integer and any integer is an even number and the leading term $ <nat:294> $ is known to be even . as well as by reason that taking the product between an even natural with some whole number must be by itself an even number the summation $ <var:W> \times <nat:294> + <var:C> \times <nat:404> + <var:u> \times <nat:316> $ is even . \end{proof} \end{document}
