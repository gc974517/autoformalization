Recall that the summing of an even natural number with an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be an even whole number . Take note $ <nat:250> * <var:j> $ is known to be an even positive integer . This claim is proven by reason that the integer $ <nat:250> $ is known as even . Building on , take note the product $ <nat:270> * <var:O> $ is even because the multiplication between an even positive integer and an arbitrary integer is even . This must be true because the whole number $ <nat:270> $ is even . as well as as a consequence that taking the product between an even natural and any natural is guaranteed to be in itself an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
