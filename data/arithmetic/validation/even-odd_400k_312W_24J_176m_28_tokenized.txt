We know the number $ <nat:400> $ is trivially an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . Accordingly , the pair $ <nat:400> * <var:k> $ must be even at the same time . The product $ <var:W> * <nat:312> $ is trivially even because taking the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and a whole number is guaranteed to be fundamentally an even integer and also the positive integer $ <nat:312> $ is known as an even number . Recall that the product $ <var:J> * <nat:24> $ is guaranteed to be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ because the multiplication of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with some element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even , which must be true since the integer $ <nat:24> $ is clearly even . Observe that the term $ <nat:176> * <var:m> $ is known as even . This is proven since the product of an even positive integer with a number will be by its very nature an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ as well as the whole number $ <nat:176> $ is guaranteed to be trivially an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . It can be proven that our claim must be true . \end{proof} \end{document}
