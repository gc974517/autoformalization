See that the term $ <nat:438> \cdot <var:W> $ is an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . This fact is proven as a consequence that the multiplication between an even whole number with an arbitrary positive integer is guaranteed to be obviously an even natural . See that the summing between even natural numbers concurrently and an even number is even . \end{proof} \end{document}
