\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:488> <var:O> + <nat:484> $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Observe $ <nat:484> $ is clearly an even positive integer . It can be demonstrated that $ <nat:484> + <nat:488> \cdot <var:O> $ is guaranteed to be even . Take note that the summing between even natural numbers will be even . Further , remember that the terms $ <nat:488> * <var:O> $ are known as even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ because the product between an even whole number with an arbitrary natural number must be even and moreover the leading terms $ <nat:488> $ are known to be by themselves even natural numbers . \end{proof} \end{document}
