Take note the summation $ <nat:440> \cdot <var:K> + <var:W> \cdot <nat:142> $ is known to be even . The term $ <nat:440> \cdot <var:K> $ is an even natural number because multiplying between an even natural number with some element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even . Building on , see that $ <nat:142> \cdot <var:W> $ is clearly an even number . This claim is proven since taking the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with an arbitrary positive integer will be itself an even natural number . It can be demonstrated that the summation $ <nat:310> + <var:W> * <nat:142> + <nat:440> * <var:K> $ will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
