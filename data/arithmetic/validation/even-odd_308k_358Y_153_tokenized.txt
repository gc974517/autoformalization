Recall the product $ <var:k> <nat:308> $ is known to be an even integer . This fact is true from the fact the multiplication between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an arbitrary positive integer is obviously an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . Likewise , the product $ <nat:358> <var:Y> $ is clearly an even natural . This fact holds since the multiplication between an even natural number with any number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be an even integer . As a consequence that the summation between an even number and even elements of $ \mathbb{N} $ will be clearly an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ , plus by reason that the product of an even number with a number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be an even integer . It can be verified that the summation $ <var:k> <nat:308> + <nat:153> + <var:Y> <nat:358> $ is guaranteed to be odd . \end{proof} \end{document}
