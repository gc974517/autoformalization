The product $ <var:w> \times <nat:460> $ is an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ as a consequence that the multiplication between an even number with any element of $ \mathbb{N} $ must be even . The product $ <var:O> \times <nat:256> $ is obviously an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ since the product of an even integer and some element of $ \mathbb{N} $ will be even . The expression $ <var:O> \cdot <nat:256> + <var:w> \cdot <nat:460> $ is guaranteed to be clearly even from the knowledge the product between even numbers with some positive integer is guaranteed to be even . See the summation of an even number with an even natural number will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
