Furthermore , the products $ <nat:10> <var:d> $ are clearly even positive integers . This holds by reason that taking the product between an even natural and an arbitrary natural number must be even as well as the integers $ <nat:10> $ are clearly fundamentally even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
