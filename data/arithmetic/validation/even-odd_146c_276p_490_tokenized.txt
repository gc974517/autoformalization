We employ that the summation $ <var:c> \cdot <nat:146> + <nat:276> \cdot <var:p> + <nat:490> $ is guaranteed to be even by reason that the summation $ <var:c> \cdot <nat:146> + <nat:276> \cdot <var:p> $ is known to be even . The term $ <nat:276> \cdot <var:p> $ is known as an even whole number . This holds from the knowledge the multiplication of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and a number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is even . See the term $ <nat:146> \cdot <var:c> $ is obviously an even integer . By reason that the adding of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and even integers will be even , and since multiplying of even elements of $ \mathbb{N} $ and some natural number is guaranteed to be in itself an even whole number . \end{proof} \end{document}
