\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} Assuming any unknowns $ <var:c> $ the summation $ <var:c> <nat:278> + <nat:416> $ will be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Notice the term $ <nat:278> * <var:c> $ is known to be even by reason that the integer $ <nat:278> $ is known to be obviously an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . Remember that the summation between even integers collectively will be an even whole number . We know that $ <nat:416> $ is known as even . \end{proof} \end{document}
