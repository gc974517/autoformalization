The main result is proven from the fact $ <nat:336> \cdot <var:n> + <nat:320> \cdot <var:o> $ is guaranteed to be even . We know the whole number $ <nat:336> $ is guaranteed to be even . Therefore , the product $ <var:n> \cdot <nat:336> $ must be even at the same time . Building on , remember the leading term $ <nat:320> $ is clearly an even natural number . Accordingly , the product $ <var:o> \cdot <nat:320> $ must be even as well . This main result is true as a consequence that the adding between an even whole number with an even integer is guaranteed to be by definition an even number additionally by reason that the multiplication between even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ and a integer must be even . It can be verified that our theorem is proven . \end{proof} \end{document}
