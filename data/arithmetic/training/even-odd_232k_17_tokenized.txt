\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} Given some $ <var:k> \in \mathbb{N} $ the formula $ <nat:17> + <nat:232> * <var:k> $ is odd . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} It can be justified that the summation $ <nat:17> + <nat:232> \times <var:k> $ is odd . Take note the summing between an even natural number with an odd natural will be odd , as well as additionally , observe taking the product between an even natural with any number is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
