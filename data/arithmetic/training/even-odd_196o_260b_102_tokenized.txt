Notice the addition of an even positive integer with an even whole number is by definition an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Notice additionally that taking the product between even integers will be an even number . See the number $ <nat:260> $ is known to be an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ We know that the natural number $ <nat:196> $ is known to be even We know that $ <nat:102> $ is even . Since the addition of even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ successively will be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ , hence this theorem holds . \end{proof} \end{document}
