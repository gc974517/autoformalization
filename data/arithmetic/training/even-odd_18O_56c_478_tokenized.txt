Additionally , observe that taking the product of an even positive integer and some natural number is an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Remember that $ <nat:478> $ is obviously even . Take note that the integer $ <nat:56> $ is obviously even Likewise , take note the number $ <nat:18> $ is known as an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ \end{proof} \end{document}
