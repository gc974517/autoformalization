In addition to this , notice the term $ <var:l> <nat:488> $ is known to be even because the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with some positive integer is an even natural . This is proven as a consequence that the positive integer $ <nat:488> $ is clearly even . See $ <var:S> <nat:282> $ is obviously an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . This claim is true because the coefficient $ <nat:282> $ is known as even . in addition to since the multiplication between even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and any integer will be by itself an even number . It can be justified that this main result is true . \end{proof} \end{document}
