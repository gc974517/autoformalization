Observe the term $ <var:K> \times <nat:212> $ is guaranteed to be even . In addition to this , the product $ <var:V> \times <nat:78> $ is guaranteed to be an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . This holds since the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ and some element of $ \mathbb{N} $ will be even . and also because the multiplication between even whole numbers and any whole number is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
