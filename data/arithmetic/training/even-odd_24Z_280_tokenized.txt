\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:280> + <nat:24> * <var:Z> $ is guaranteed to be even assuming some positive terms $ <var:Z> $ . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} It can be justified that the result holds by employing the understanding the addition between an even natural and an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is even as well as multiplying between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with any number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even . Notice $ <nat:280> $ is obviously an even positive integer . \end{proof} \end{document}
