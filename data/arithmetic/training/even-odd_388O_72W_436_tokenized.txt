Notice the sum $ <nat:436> + <nat:388> \times <var:O> + <nat:72> \times <var:W> $ is trivially even from the knowledge the formula $ <var:O> * <nat:388> + <var:W> * <nat:72> $ is known as even . Recall that the whole number $ <nat:388> $ is guaranteed to be an even natural Recall the positive integer $ <nat:72> $ is guaranteed to be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ Our theorem must be true by reason that the adding of even positive integers with an even number will be by its very nature an even natural in addition to from the fact multiplying of even integers with an arbitrary element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be even . It can be demonstrated that this theorem is proven . \end{proof} \end{document}
