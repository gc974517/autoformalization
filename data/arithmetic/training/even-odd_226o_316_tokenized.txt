Observe that the summation between an even positive integer and an even number will be even . $ <var:o> * <nat:226> $ is clearly even from the fact multiplying of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with an arbitrary natural must be by its very nature an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
