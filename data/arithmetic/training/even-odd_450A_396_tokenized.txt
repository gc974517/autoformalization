This claim is proven by reason that taking the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ and a number will be in itself an even whole number in addition to the natural numbers $ <nat:450> $ are known as in themselves even natural numbers . Take note the summation between an even natural number and an even number will be even . Remember that $ <nat:396> $ is obviously an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
