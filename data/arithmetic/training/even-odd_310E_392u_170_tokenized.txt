Take note that $ <var:E> \cdot <nat:310> $ is known to be an even integer . This claim is proven from the fact multiplying between an even whole number with any number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is even . This fact must be true by reason that the whole number $ <nat:310> $ is even . In addition , remember the pair $ <nat:392> \cdot <var:u> $ is clearly an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ as a consequence that the product between an even whole number with an arbitrary positive integer is even . This fact is true from the knowledge the leading term $ <nat:392> $ is clearly obviously an even number . The formula $ <nat:310> <var:E> + <nat:392> <var:u> $ is by definition even as a consequence that the multiplication between even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and any integer will be itself an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Recall that $ <nat:170> $ is obviously an even positive integer . The summing between an even natural and an even integer will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
