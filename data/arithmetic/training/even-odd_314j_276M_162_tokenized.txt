\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:314> * <var:j> + <nat:162> + <nat:276> * <var:M> $ is even with every integers $ <var:M> $ , and $ <var:j> $ . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Notice that $ <nat:314> <var:j> + <nat:162> + <nat:276> <var:M> $ is known to be even as a consequence that $ <var:j> <nat:314> + <var:M> <nat:276> $ is even . The pair $ <nat:314> \times <var:j> $ is trivially an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . This must be true since the positive integer $ <nat:314> $ is known to be fundamentally an even natural . Likewise , the pair $ <var:M> \times <nat:276> $ is guaranteed to be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . This holds from the knowledge taking the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with some number must be by its very nature an even number . This holds since the positive integer $ <nat:276> $ is even . The summation $ <var:j> \cdot <nat:314> + <nat:276> \cdot <var:M> $ is guaranteed to be even from the fact the summing between even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ and an even positive integer will be even as well as from the knowledge taking the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with a natural is by itself an even number . It can be justified that the lemma is proven . Observe that $ <nat:162> $ is trivially an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
