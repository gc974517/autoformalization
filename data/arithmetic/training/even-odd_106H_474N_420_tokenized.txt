This fact is true from the fact taking the product of an even natural number and a element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be in itself an even integer , and holds by reason that the leading term $ <nat:106> $ is known as by its very nature an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . The coefficient $ <nat:474> $ is trivially even . For this reason , the product $ <var:N> <nat:474> $ is guaranteed to be even as well . The summing of even naturals successively is instrinsically an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
