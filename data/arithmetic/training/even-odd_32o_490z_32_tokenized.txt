Recall that $ <nat:32> $ is clearly an even integer . Recall that the product $ <var:z> * <nat:490> $ is an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ as a consequence that taking the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with some whole number is an even whole number . Take note the pair $ <var:o> * <nat:32> $ is known to be an even whole number . This fact is true from the fact the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with any number in $ \mathbb{N} $ is clearly an even number . \end{proof} \end{document}
