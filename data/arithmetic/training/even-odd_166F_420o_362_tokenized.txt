Recall the pair $ <var:F> <nat:166> $ is known as even . This fact holds because taking the product of an even natural with an arbitrary natural is even . What's more , the term $ <var:o> <nat:420> $ is obviously even since multiplying between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and a number is obviously an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
