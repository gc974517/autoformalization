Consequently , this result must be true . We know that $ <nat:50> $ is guaranteed to be an even natural number . We know $ <nat:492> \times <var:s> $ is guaranteed to be even . This claim is proven because the product between an even natural number with a number is guaranteed to be even , which is true as a consequence that the whole number $ <nat:492> $ is known as by definition an even natural . \end{proof} \end{document}
