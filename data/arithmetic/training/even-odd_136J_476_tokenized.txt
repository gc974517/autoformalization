\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} For all positive integers $ <var:J> $ the expression $ <nat:476> + <nat:136> \cdot <var:J> $ is even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Notice that $ <nat:476> $ is known as an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . Starting , notice that the adding between even numbers in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ concurrently with an even integer will be an even positive integer , as well as similarly , see the product of an even whole number and an arbitrary natural number is even . The number $ <nat:136> $ is guaranteed to be even \end{proof} \end{document}
