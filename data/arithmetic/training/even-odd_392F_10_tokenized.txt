\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} Using all variables $ <var:F> $ the expression $ <nat:392> \cdot <var:F> + <nat:10> $ is even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Observe that the product $ <nat:392> <var:F> $ is known as even by reason that taking the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with an arbitrary whole number is even . The adding between an even natural and an even integer will be by itself an even integer . \end{proof} \end{document}
