Take note that $ <nat:234> $ is obviously an even integer . It can be demonstrated that the formula $ <var:k> \times <nat:52> + <nat:234> + <nat:270> \times <var:p> $ is guaranteed to be even since $ <var:p> * <nat:270> + <nat:52> * <var:k> $ is known to be even . Since the addition of an even natural and even integers will be even , as well as from the fact taking the product between an even number and some number in $ \mathbb{N} $ will be an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
