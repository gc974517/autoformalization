The term $ <var:R> * <nat:222> $ is known to be even because multiplying of an even number and a number must be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . Building on , recall the pair $ <var:c> * <nat:204> $ is known as even as a consequence that the multiplication between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ and any whole number is guaranteed to be an even whole number . By reason that the totaling of even natural numbers and an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ is guaranteed to be even , this main result holds . \end{proof} \end{document}
