This claim is true since the multiplication between an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and any element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and also the natural number $ <nat:388> $ is known as even . Remember the natural number $ <nat:482> $ is clearly an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Thus , the term $ <var:V> \times <nat:482> $ is guaranteed to be even in addition . In addition , we know that the pair $ <var:d> \times <nat:94> $ is known to be even by reason that taking the product of an even natural number and some number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . This is proven as a consequence that the natural number $ <nat:94> $ is clearly obviously an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Take note the product $ <var:S> \times <nat:196> $ is obviously even from the fact taking the product of an even whole number and some natural number is guaranteed to be an even positive integer as well as the whole number $ <nat:196> $ is obviously even . See $ <nat:38> $ is clearly an even integer . The addition between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an even number is instrinsically an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
