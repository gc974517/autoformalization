Observe $ <nat:48> $ is trivially an even whole number . The product $ <nat:180> * <var:V> $ is trivially even . This fact holds from the fact multiplying between an even natural number with some natural number must be by its very nature an even number additionally the number $ <nat:180> $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
