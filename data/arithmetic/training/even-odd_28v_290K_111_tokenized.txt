We know that the expression $ <nat:290> * <var:K> + <var:v> * <nat:28> + <nat:111> $ is trivially odd as a consequence that $ <var:v> * <nat:28> + <nat:290> * <var:K> $ is known to be even . The term $ <nat:290> * <var:K> $ is an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . In addition , the term $ <var:v> * <nat:28> $ is clearly an even positive integer . This is true from the knowledge the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an arbitrary number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even . This result holds since the adding of an even number and even elements of $ \mathbb{N} $ must be trivially an even natural number and likewise from the knowledge multiplying of even naturals and any natural will be in itself an even positive integer . It can be justified that the result is proven . \end{proof} \end{document}
