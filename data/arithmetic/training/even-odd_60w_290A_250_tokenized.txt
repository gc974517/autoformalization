Take note that the formula $ <nat:60> \cdot <var:w> + <var:A> \cdot <nat:290> + <nat:250> $ is obviously even by reason that the formula $ <nat:60> \cdot <var:w> + <var:A> \cdot <nat:290> $ is known as even . We know the addition between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ must be obviously an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Recall that the term $ <nat:290> <var:A> $ is clearly even because the product between an even natural number and some positive integer will be by its very nature an even number additionally the leading term $ <nat:290> $ is obviously even . Further , take note the positive integer $ <nat:60> $ is known to be even . Then , the product $ <var:w> <nat:60> $ is guaranteed to be even also . in addition to since the multiplication between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with some number is guaranteed to be even the claim holds . It can be proven that the summation $ <nat:250> + <var:w> \cdot <nat:60> + <nat:290> \cdot <var:A> $ will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
