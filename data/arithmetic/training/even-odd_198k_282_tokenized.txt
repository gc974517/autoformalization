\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} $ <nat:282> + <var:k> \cdot <nat:198> $ is guaranteed to be even for every positive terms $ <var:k> $ . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Recall $ <nat:282> $ is clearly even . It can be shown that this theorem is true according to the understanding that the totaling between an even number with an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ is guaranteed to be an even positive integer . The leading term $ <nat:198> $ is known to be even . Thus , $ <nat:198> <var:k> $ is even as well . \end{proof} \end{document}
