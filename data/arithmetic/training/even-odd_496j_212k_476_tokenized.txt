We work with the assumption the understanding the sum $ <nat:496> \times <var:j> + <var:k> \times <nat:212> + <nat:476> $ is known as even as a consequence that the summation $ <var:j> * <nat:496> + <nat:212> * <var:k> $ is trivially even . Since the addition of even numbers in $ \mathbb{N} $ with even numbers in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is itself an even positive integer , plus since taking the product between even whole numbers with a natural number is guaranteed to be even . The summing of an even natural number with an even positive integer must be an even number . \end{proof} \end{document}
