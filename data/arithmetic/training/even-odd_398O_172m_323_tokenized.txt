On top of this , recall the pair $ <nat:172> * <var:m> $ is even . This fact is proven as a consequence that the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with some natural will be even . The addition between an even integer and an odd number in $ \mathbb{N} $ must be odd . Accordingly , this theorem is true . \end{proof} \end{document}
