Observe $ <nat:98> $ is clearly even . Building on , observe the products $ <var:Q> \cdot <nat:384> $ are guaranteed to be even . This claim is proven since the multiplication between an even natural with some whole number must be even , which is true because the natural numbers $ <nat:384> $ are trivially by their very nature even integers . \end{proof} \end{document}
