We check the sum $ <nat:44> <var:S> + <nat:202> + <nat:138> <var:H> $ is guaranteed to be even . Starting , recall the summing between an even number with an even natural will be by itself an even whole number , as well as next off , remember that the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with a number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ will be obviously an even natural number . \end{proof} \end{document}
