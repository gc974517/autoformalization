Our theorem is proven by reason that $ <nat:204> \times <var:M> + <nat:362> \times <var:h> $ is guaranteed to be even . The term $ <var:M> * <nat:204> $ is guaranteed to be an even number by reason that the product between an even positive integer and some integer must be by its very nature an even whole number . The product $ <nat:362> * <var:h> $ is trivially even because the multiplication of an even natural number and an arbitrary whole number will be in itself an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . From the knowledge the multiplication between even natural numbers with any whole number must be instrinsically an even positive integer the formula $ <nat:362> <var:h> + <var:M> <nat:204> $ will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
