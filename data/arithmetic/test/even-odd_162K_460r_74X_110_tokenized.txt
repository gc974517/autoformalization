\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} Using any $ <var:K> $ , $ <var:X> $ , and $ <var:r> \in \mathbb{Z}^+ $ $ <var:K> \cdot <nat:162> + <nat:460> \cdot <var:r> + <nat:74> \cdot <var:X> + <nat:110> $ must be even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Remember that the addition between an even whole number with an even number must be an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Take note the product $ <nat:74> <var:X> $ is guaranteed to be even . This fact holds as a consequence that the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with some natural number must be even . The term $ <var:K> <nat:162> $ is known to be an even integer . This claim holds by reason that multiplying between an even natural number with any whole number is guaranteed to be even . On top of this , the pair $ <nat:460> <var:r> $ is known as an even natural number by reason that taking the product between an even natural with any natural must be an even whole number . We justify this main result holds . \end{proof} \end{document}
