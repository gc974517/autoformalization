\documentclass[12pt]{article} \usepackage{amsthm,amsfonts,amssymb} \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} \begin{document} \begin{theorem} Using all natural numbers $ <var:L> $ the summation $ <nat:410> + <var:L> * <nat:152> $ is even . \end{theorem} \begin{proof} Remember the product $ <nat:152> \times <var:L> $ is trivially an even number by reason that the product between an even positive integer with any element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be even . This must be true by reason that the whole number $ <nat:152> $ is known as even . See $ <nat:410> $ is known to be even . From the fact the summing of an even whole number and an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be an even integer , as a result this result is true . \end{proof} \end{document}
