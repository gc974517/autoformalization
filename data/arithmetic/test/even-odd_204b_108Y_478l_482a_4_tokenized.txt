Take note the product $ <var:b> \times <nat:204> $ is trivially even . This must be true by reason that taking the product of an even positive integer and any whole number must be even , which is proven since the positive integer $ <nat:204> $ is known as even . The term $ <var:a> \times <nat:482> $ is clearly even by reason that multiplying of an even number with some number in $ \mathbb{N} $ must be an even natural number additionally the number $ <nat:482> $ is obviously by its very nature an even natural number . In addition to this , remember that the pair $ <nat:478> \times <var:l> $ is known as an even number since taking the product of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and some natural will be even , and is proven as a consequence that the natural number $ <nat:478> $ is known as in itself an even whole number . Likewise , the integer $ <nat:108> $ is known as an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . In consequence , $ <nat:108> \times <var:Y> $ must be even additionally . It can be demonstrated that the expression $ <nat:204> * <var:b> + <var:Y> * <nat:108> + <var:l> * <nat:478> + <nat:4> + <var:a> * <nat:482> $ is even . \end{proof} \end{document}
