It can be checked that $ <nat:88> <var:v> + <nat:476> + <var:R> <nat:490> $ is trivially even by reason that $ <nat:88> \times <var:v> + <var:R> \times <nat:490> $ is known to be even . Notice that the leading term $ <nat:490> $ is even Remember the leading term $ <nat:88> $ is known as even Since the totaling of even natural numbers and an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ will be an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ , in addition to from the knowledge taking the product of an even integer with some positive integer will be even . The summing of even naturals and an even whole number must be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
