Recall $ <nat:12> \cdot <var:k> $ is trivially even . This is proven from the fact the multiplication of an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an arbitrary natural number will be by its very nature an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ . This fact is true from the fact the coefficient $ <nat:12> $ is obviously even . We justify our theorem must be true . \end{proof} \end{document}
