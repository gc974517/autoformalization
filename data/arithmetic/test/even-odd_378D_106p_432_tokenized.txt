We use the fact the expression $ <nat:432> + <nat:106> <var:p> + <var:D> <nat:378> $ is known as even as a consequence that the expression $ <nat:378> \cdot <var:D> + <nat:106> \cdot <var:p> $ is clearly even . Recall the adding of even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ together and an even integer is even . The term $ <var:p> * <nat:106> $ is guaranteed to be even . This holds since multiplying of an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with an arbitrary positive integer will be even . In addition , recall that the pair $ <nat:378> * <var:D> $ is known as an even number . and also because the multiplication of an even whole number with an arbitrary whole number will be an even positive integer . Take note that the addition between an even positive integer and an even number is an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . \end{proof} \end{document}
