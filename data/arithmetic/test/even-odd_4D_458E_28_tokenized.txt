From the knowledge the adding between even elements of $ \mathbb{N} $ and an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be itself an even whole number , hence the expression $ <nat:28> + <nat:4> \cdot <var:D> + <var:E> \cdot <nat:458> $ is even . We demonstrate that $ <nat:458> \times <var:E> + <nat:4> \times <var:D> $ is obviously even . See that the coefficient $ <nat:4> $ is even . Thus , the product $ <nat:4> <var:D> $ is even at the same time . Building on , the term $ <var:E> <nat:458> $ is guaranteed to be an even positive integer since taking the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with some integer is guaranteed to be by its very nature an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ as well as the leading term $ <nat:458> $ is guaranteed to be even . The main result must be true by reason that the adding of an even positive integer and an even natural number will be by its very nature an even number and moreover since taking the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with a natural will be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
