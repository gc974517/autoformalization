It can be proven that $ <nat:158> + <nat:436> * <var:P> $ is guaranteed to be even in connection with the knowledge that the summing between an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an even positive integer is in itself an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and moreover the multiplication of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with a natural is guaranteed to be instrinsically an even integer . \end{proof} \end{document}
