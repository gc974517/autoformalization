We justify the formula $ <nat:132> + <var:X> \times <nat:176> + <var:K> \times <nat:386> $ is known as even from the fact the expression $ <nat:176> \times <var:X> + <nat:386> \times <var:K> $ is guaranteed to be even . We know that the integer $ <nat:386> $ is clearly even The natural number $ <nat:176> $ is known as even The sum $ <var:X> \times <nat:176> + <var:K> \times <nat:386> $ must be even as a consequence that the summing between even elements of $ \mathbb{N} $ and even naturals is guaranteed to be even and moreover from the fact the product between even elements of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and a natural number must be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
