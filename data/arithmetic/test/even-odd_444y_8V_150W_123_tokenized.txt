We know that $ <nat:123> $ is guaranteed to be an odd natural number . We use that the formula $ <nat:8> * <var:V> + <nat:123> + <var:W> * <nat:150> + <nat:444> * <var:y> $ is clearly odd from the knowledge $ <var:W> * <nat:150> + <nat:8> * <var:V> + <nat:444> * <var:y> $ is known to be even . Recall the product $ <nat:444> * <var:y> $ is even as a consequence that the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ and any integer will be fundamentally an even number in addition to the leading term $ <nat:444> $ is obviously even . On top of this , $ <nat:8> * <var:V> $ is clearly even . This fact is proven from the knowledge the leading term $ <nat:8> $ is known to be an even natural . Additionally , $ <nat:150> * <var:W> $ is clearly an even integer . This fact must be true by reason that taking the product of an even whole number with any integer will be an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ , which is true because the whole number $ <nat:150> $ is obviously even . This lemma is proven by reason that the addition between even numbers with an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even and from the fact the multiplication between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ with any element of $ \mathbb{N} $ is guaranteed to be even . \end{proof} \end{document}
