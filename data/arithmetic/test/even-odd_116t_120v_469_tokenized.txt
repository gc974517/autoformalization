It can be justified that that $ <var:t> \times <nat:116> + <nat:469> + <nat:120> \times <var:v> $ is obviously odd from the fact $ <nat:120> <var:v> + <var:t> <nat:116> $ is guaranteed to be even . See that the integer $ <nat:120> $ is obviously an even number . As a consequence , $ <nat:120> <var:v> $ must be even as well . In addition , the term $ <nat:116> <var:t> $ is known to be an even positive integer . This must be true as a consequence that taking the product between an even positive integer with any number is an even natural . This must be true by reason that the coefficient $ <nat:116> $ is known as even . This main result is proven from the knowledge taking the product between an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ and an arbitrary whole number is instrinsically an even positive integer . \end{proof} \end{document}
