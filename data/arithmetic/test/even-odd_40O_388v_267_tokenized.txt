Recall that the product $ <nat:40> * <var:O> $ is even from the knowledge the multiplication of an even integer and some positive integer will be even , which is proven by reason that the number $ <nat:40> $ is even . In addition , take note that $ <nat:388> * <var:v> $ is known as even since the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with a element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ plus the whole number $ <nat:388> $ is an even integer . additionally since multiplying between even naturals with a integer is even . \end{proof} \end{document}
