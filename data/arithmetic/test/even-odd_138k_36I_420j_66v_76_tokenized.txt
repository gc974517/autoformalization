See the totaling of an even element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ will be obviously an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Observe that $ <var:k> \cdot <nat:138> $ is known as even from the fact the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ with a element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ is guaranteed to be even . This is proven from the knowledge the coefficient $ <nat:138> $ is known as even . Adding on , notice that the product $ <var:I> \cdot <nat:36> $ is guaranteed to be even from the knowledge taking the product between an even natural number with an arbitrary natural number is an even natural and moreover the leading term $ <nat:36> $ is clearly even . On top of this , remember that the pair $ <nat:420> \cdot <var:j> $ is clearly even from the fact the multiplication of an even positive integer and some element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be by its very nature an even whole number plus the number $ <nat:420> $ is even . Observe the product $ <nat:66> \cdot <var:v> $ is known to be even as a consequence that the number $ <nat:66> $ is even . \end{proof} \end{document}
