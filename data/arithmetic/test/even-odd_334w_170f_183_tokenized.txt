We know $ <nat:334> <var:w> $ is obviously an even integer . This fact is true as a consequence that the product of an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ and any natural must be even . The term $ <var:f> <nat:170> $ is even . This claim is true because the product of an even integer and an arbitrary number in $ \mathbb{N} $ must be an even whole number . Since the totaling of an even whole number with an even natural number is even , and likewise because taking the product between an even positive integer with some integer is guaranteed to be by its very nature an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ . Take note that $ <nat:183> $ is known to be odd . We demonstrate the theorem is true . \end{proof} \end{document}
