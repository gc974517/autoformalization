The leading term $ <nat:266> $ is known to be even . Then , the product $ <nat:266> \times <var:D> $ is even additionally . Additionally , we know that the integer $ <nat:496> $ is an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . Then , $ <nat:496> \times <var:M> $ must be even at the same time . and moreover because the product between an even number in $ \mathbb{N} $ with some whole number will be obviously an even natural number . Observe $ <nat:300> $ is known as even . By reason that the adding between an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ and an even whole number is guaranteed to be instrinsically an even element of $ \mathbb{N} $ , as a result our lemma is proven . \end{proof} \end{document}
