The pair $ <nat:404> \cdot <var:r> $ is clearly an even number in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ . This claim is proven since the multiplication between an even natural number with any integer is an even integer . Building on , the term $ <var:y> \cdot <nat:368> $ is obviously even . This fact is true as a consequence that taking the product between an even integer and some element of $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ must be even . From the fact the summing of even integers with even numbers in $ \mathbb{Z}^+ $ will be itself an even positive integer , plus as a consequence that the multiplication of an even number with some natural number is guaranteed to be instrinsically an even integer . It can be checked that the result is proven . \end{proof} \end{document}
