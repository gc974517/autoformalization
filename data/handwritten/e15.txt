Since <nat:58> is even , then $ <nat:58> \times <var:a> $ is even . Similarly , since <nat:38> is even , then $ <nat:38> \times <var:b> $ is even as well . It is also known that the sum of even numbers is even , therefore the expression $ <nat:58> \times <var:a> + <nat:38> \times <var:b> $ must be even . The addition of an odd number with an even number is an odd number . Since $ <nat:58> \times <var:a> + <nat:38> \times <var:b> $ is even and <nat:85> is odd , their sum $ <nat:58> \times <var:a> + <nat:38> \times <var:b> + <nat:85> $ must be odd . \end{proof} \end{document}
